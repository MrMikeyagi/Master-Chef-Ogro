These textures are licensed under the GPL 2.0 or later. unfortunately the author has very odd views on the world, so we won't disclose his name here, feel free to ask me (Hirato) on quakenet.org if you'd like his name. 

The normal maps were of course created by moi, as the darkplaces engine creates normalmaps and bump maps for all textures if none are available.
