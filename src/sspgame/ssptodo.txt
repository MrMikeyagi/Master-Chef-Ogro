** light up player character

* weapons
** code to handle weapon damage

* box
** headbutt activates and drops a pickup, the box is optionally destroyed

* HUD
*** revamp ssptest map to use them in a tutorial
** icons for equipped armour and weapon

* armour
** model tags, and models
** desired effects, anti grav armour and electromagnetic (attracts pickups)
** allow armours to have more than 1 setting defined, ie, both attract and flight

* movement
** slow down rotation, it's too snappy
