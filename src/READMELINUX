Linux Users, chances are you'll need to compile the server and the client from source.

The source files are unfortunately in DOS format, so you'll need to search your distrution's package manager for a utility names 'tofrodos'. While it's harmless, the enet files WILL cause problems while in DOS format

once that's done installing, just open a terminal and copy the following line into it, after changing your directory the src/

fromdos enet/* && fromdos enet/*/* && chmod + x enet/configure && make install

for any subsequent builds, make clean and make install are all you'll need.

Make sure you have the needed SDL libs installed. normal sdl, with sdl mixer, and sdl image, and probably other packages like smpeg and timidity to allow sdl_mixer to access additional audio formats.

alternatively, if you wish, you can just type sh build.sh and it'll take care of pretty much everything
