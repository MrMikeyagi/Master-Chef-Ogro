Things to finish buckling down on for release!

-better HUD display for health/mana.
-spells finalized - spells are way too small in particle radius, note 9 would be awesome if it was at 90 degrees
-all maps finished rpg_01 -> cave -> forest -> dungeon2 -> glitchworld-> glitchworld2  (please update if any new maps should be in there, according to progression)
-map order sorted. (Well if tom makes a map it will be inbetween forest and dungeon2)

Low Priority
-a melee weapon (vegetablize sword mapmodel)
-finish master chef ogro's character model (chef clothing put on him)
-completed king skin
-old test map integrated
-better looking health bar for enemies.

Features to add
- Checkpoints (assigned to Hirato)
- vegetable monsters revert back to a vegetable (loot) (assigned to Mike)
-another vegetable monster besides a cabbage. (Only thing people would probably complain about in the finished version)

Bugs to fix:
- newline for quests/text/dialog not working (assigned to Linuxdonald)
- playerstarts default team red (temp fix newent playerstart neutral)
-enemies sometimes don't hurt you when they touch you. and you can kill them without out them hurting you.

Feature Wishlist:
- Save files
- Scoring system?  (coins/score per level)
- Cabbage Golem Boss Being able to attack "quin because melee attacks are basically a shortened ray. maybe a radial with a yaw offset checkor make it actually aim down at you and increase the shorten distance depending on the height"
- icons replaced before any release
- flowers?
- translucient menu



Edit:
thanks mike, thats a much better sorted version of what I put.
and BTW, couldn't we just vegetablize the long sword mapmodel already in sandbox for the melee weapon? And if I make some blender models, could you please convert them to md3 for me or something, I've tried all the tutorials and just can't seem to get it.
