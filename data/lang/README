The menus.cfg here is regularly maintained. as the non translated one always loads first, there's no need to touch the aliases, so I beg you to use this menus.cfg and not copy in the one from, /data.

files /language will load

data/lang/&&language/lang.cfg 
data/lang/&&language/menus.cfg
data/lang/&&language/game_&&gametype.cfg
